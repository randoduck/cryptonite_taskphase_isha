## Thought Process 
The Hint given was pretty clear that the challenge had to do something with rotation. Hence I opened the Text file which also included curly brackets, Indicating affter rotation we would directly obtain the flag . Next, Headed over to https://rot13.com , experimented with different Rotation Techniques and the flag was obtained at rot18 .
