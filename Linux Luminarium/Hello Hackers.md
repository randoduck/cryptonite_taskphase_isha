# Hello Hackers

## Challenge 1 : Intro to commands : Summary / Learnings

The challenge was to obtain the flag by invoking the hello command.
Linux commands are **case-sensitive**, so typing "hello" is different from typing "HELLO."

### Solution

Flag was received when the following command was executed :
`hello`

## Intro to Arguments Summary / Learnings :
Arguments are additional data passed to the command. When you type a line of text and hit enter, the shell actually parses your input into a command and its arguments. The first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments.
echo is a simple command that "echoes" all of its arguments back out onto the terminal
In this challenge to get the flag, we needed to run the hello command with a single argument of hackers.

### Solution

Flag was received when the following command was executed :
`hello hackers`
